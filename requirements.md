1. Zero state
- input field for guessing the number
- button for submitting a guess
- button for clearing input field
- button to reset the game

2. User's Guess State
- Display user's most recent guess
- Display results and feedback
  - "That is too high"
  - "That is too low"
  - "BOOM!"

Notes
- input fields always store values as strings
- Need to figure out how to generate random numbers

--
1. Create a github repository and link to local repo

2. Create a package json with the stuff I need including mocha, chai, react, and redux

3. Create an index.html with a main tag where everything will go.
